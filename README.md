## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Core Structure**: HTML5, Vanilla CSS3, ES6 JavaScript. No external build steps, bundlers, or package managers required.
- **Rendering System**: Standard 2D HTML5 Canvas calculations map the 15x15 Ludo grid. Handles custom vector shapes for bases, circular yards, track tiles, and safe zone stars.
- **Stacking Logic**: Token overlap positions are calculated automatically when multiple tokens land on the same tile, splitting them into side-by-side offsets, keeping them individually targetable on mobile viewports.
- **Audio synthesis**: Utilizes the native browser **Web Audio API** to generate retro sweeps, rattle oscillations, capture crash sounds, and victory chimes directly inside `sounds.js` — offering 100% offline coverage with zero download latency.
- **AI Heuristics Engine**:
  - **Easy**: Selects randomly among valid moves.
  - **Medium**: Prefers moves that capture opponent tokens or launch tokens out of bases.
  - **Hard**: Scores moves using heuristic evaluations (escape paths, safe zone landings, home stretch progress, trailing opponent distances, and capture opportunities).

## ⚙️ Customization & Developer Hooks

- **Modify Track Coordinates**: To customize cell grids, modify the coordinates in the `TRACK` array in `board.js`.
- **Adjust Bot Scoring**: Inside `ai.js`, modify the scoring weights (e.g. `score += 1000` for captures) in the hard AI mode to change how bots prioritize tasks.
- **Change Sound Frequencies**: In `sounds.js`, alter the oscillator types (`sine`, `triangle`, `sawtooth`, `square`) and duration frequency values to customize note pitches.
